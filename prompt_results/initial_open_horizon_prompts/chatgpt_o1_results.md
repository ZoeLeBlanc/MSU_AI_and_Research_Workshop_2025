## Thinking Results

To gather relevant materials, I’m digging into Michigan State University's Libraries Digital Collections for topics like "histories of information" and "digital humanities." Options include archives, specialized collections, and potentially additional archives.

Considering materials like old yearbooks, newspapers, and ephemeral documents, Michigan State University's collection includes "Michigan State University Archives and Historical Collections" and "agricultural extension bulletins." The Radicalism collection, with radical movement materials, might particularly intrigue.

I'm noting several resources: "Digital Michigan Newspaper Portal," "Vincent Voice Library," "Russel B. Nye Popular Culture Collection," and "On The Banks of the Red Cedar" for their relevance to digital humanities and information history.

## Model Response

Below you’ll find an overview of some Michigan State University (MSU) Libraries digital collections and resources that are especially fruitful for research at the intersection of the history of information and the digital humanities. While this is not an exhaustive list, it provides a starting point for exploring historical documents, multimedia archives, and materials that lend themselves to digital methods and analysis.

1. G. Robert Vincent Voice Library
What it is: One of the largest academic voice libraries in the nation, housing over 100,000 hours of spoken word recordings. This collection includes speeches, interviews, and broadcasts by historical figures.
Why it’s relevant: The Voice Library is ripe for digital humanities work—scholars can use computational text and audio analysis to trace patterns in language, rhetoric, and the dissemination of information across the 20th century. The collection offers insight into how recorded sound helped shape the modern era’s information ecosystem.

2. Michigan Digital Newspaper Portal
What it is: A gateway to digitized historical newspapers from across Michigan, including local and regional publications dating back to the 19th century.
Why it’s relevant: Newspapers are prime sources for examining how information was produced, circulated, and received over time. Researchers in the digital humanities can use text mining, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to understand shifting social, political, and cultural narratives.

3. Comic Art Collection
What it is: An extensive collection of comic books and comic art, housed at MSU Libraries. While the bulk is physical, a growing subset of this material is available in digital format.
Why it’s relevant: Comics are often overlooked in more traditional “histories of information,” but they are crucial for understanding visual storytelling, popular culture, and the evolution of mass media. Digital humanists can study metadata (issue dates, publishers, artists), analyze visual culture, or examine the role of comics in broader media history.

4. Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project
What it is: A collection of digitized cookbooks from the late 18th to early 20th centuries, reflecting social norms, cultural exchange, and historical information networks around food.
Why it’s relevant: Although it seems specialized, historic cookbooks contain rich data on consumer culture, domestic education, and community knowledge systems—perfect for quantitative or qualitative digital humanities methods. Studying this corpus can highlight how information about nutrition, health, and domestic science was circulated, standardized, or contested over time.

5. Digital Projects from MSU Special Collections
What it is: MSU’s Special Collections often digitize unique materials—pamphlets, ephemera, rare books—that can shed light on the history of ideas, activism, and social movements. For instance, the American Radicalism Collection includes pamphlets, newspapers, and manifestos spanning several centuries.
Why it’s relevant: The circulation of radical or alternative viewpoints offers insights into underground or non-mainstream information networks. These documents lend themselves well to digital projects involving document analysis, geospatial mapping of radical movements, or network analysis of organizations and publishers.

6. Collaborations with LEADR and DH@MSU
While not a “collection” per se, MSU’s Lab for the Education and Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR) and Digital Humanities at MSU (DH@MSU) initiatives are essential for anyone doing digitally inflected research. They often work with library materials, help develop digital projects, and provide guidance on digital tools (like text mining, network analysis, GIS, data visualization, etc.).
Why it’s relevant: Partnering with LEADR or attending DH@MSU events can help you identify and access digital collections more effectively, learn the latest methods, and connect with peers and mentors conducting parallel research.

Tips for Getting Started
Identify a Thematic Focus: Whether you’re interested in the evolution of mass media, the role of public discourse in shaping information networks, or how marginalized voices circulated their messages, define your theme first. This will help you narrow down relevant sub-collections.

Try Text Mining & Other DH Methods: Many of MSU’s digital collections are well-suited for computational analysis. Learn tools like Voyant, AntConc, or MALLET for topic modeling. If you are interested in mapping or geospatial analysis, consider ArcGIS or QGIS to visualize data from historical newspapers or pamphlets.

Use Finding Aids & Librarian Expertise: MSU librarians, especially those in the Digital Scholarship Lab or Special Collections, can point you to specialized or newly digitized materials not immediately visible on the website. Reach out and describe your research interests—they can save you time by recommending the best resources.

Check Copyright & Usage Guidelines: If you plan to publish or present digital humanities research that uses large data sets (e.g., OCR text from newspapers or audio from the Voice Library), be sure to review reuse policies and obtain any necessary permissions.

In Summary
Michigan State University has a rich array of digital collections that can be approached through the lens of the history of information. Whether you choose to explore historical newspapers, radical pamphlets, audio recordings, or rare cookbooks, each set of materials can illuminate different facets of how knowledge has been produced, circulated, and archived over time. By combining these primary sources with digital humanities tools and approaches, you’ll be well on your way to creating a novel, impactful project.

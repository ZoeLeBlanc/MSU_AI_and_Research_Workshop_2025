I need to point out that I don't have direct access to Michigan State University's Libraries Digital Collections or a live database to search through. While I'm familiar with the general nature of academic digital collections, I can't make specific recommendations about materials that are currently in MSU's collections.

However, I can suggest some types of materials you might want to look for in their digital collections, based on your interest in histories of information and digital humanities:

1. Historical newspapers and periodicals from Michigan, which often document the evolution of information dissemination
2. University records and administrative documents that show how information was organized and managed institutionally
3. Early computing and technology records, if available, particularly those related to MSU's adoption of digital systems
4. Archives of correspondence and communication methods
5. Historical maps and data visualizations that show how information was represented

I'd recommend:
1. Visiting MSU Libraries' Digital Collections website directly
2. Consulting with MSU's digital collections librarians or archivists
3. Using their online finding aids and catalog to search for these types of materials

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or discuss specific approaches to working with digital collections for information history research?

That sounds like an exciting project! Michigan State University (MSU) Libraries have a wealth of resources that could be highly relevant to your interests in the histories of information and digital humanities. Here are a few recommendations:

1. **Digital Humanities Projects**: MSU's Digital Humanities (DH) team collaborates on various projects that analyze cultural materials using digital methods. These projects often involve text analysis, image analysis, network analysis, and visualization[1](https://lib.msu.edu/dh). You might find inspiration or even potential collaborators through their ongoing projects.

2. **Digital Repository**: The MSU Libraries Digital Collections provide access to a wide range of materials, including audio, documents, newspapers, journals, images, and data[2](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul). This repository is a great place to find primary sources and other materials that can be used for historical research and digital humanities projects.

3. **Global Digital Humanities Symposium**: MSU hosts an annual Global Digital Humanities Symposium that brings together researchers from around the world[3](https://digitalhumanities.msu.edu/). Attending or reviewing past symposiums could provide valuable insights and connections for your project.

4. **Special Collections**: Explore specific collections within the digital repository that focus on historical documents and archives. These collections can offer rich primary sources for studying the history of information.

Michigan State University's Libraries Digital Collections offer a wealth of materials that align with your research interests in the histories of information, media, and the Global South, as well as your focus on computational methods in historical study. Here are some specific collections that may be particularly relevant:

### **1. MSU Vietnam Group Archive**
- **Content:** Documents, maps, and images from 1955–1962 related to Michigan State University's involvement in Vietnam during the Cold War.
- **Relevance:** This collection provides insight into post-1945 development initiatives and U.S. interventions in the Global South, making it an excellent resource for studying media representations and knowledge production during this period[1][3].

### **2. Voices of MSU**
- **Content:** Oral histories featuring interviews with minority students, faculty, and staff at MSU.
- **Relevance:** These interviews could be valuable for exploring narratives of marginalized groups and their representation in institutional histories, as well as for computational text analysis of oral history transcripts[1][3].

### **3. MSU Yearbooks (1887–Present)**
- **Content:** Digitized yearbooks documenting student life, events, and campus culture over more than a century.
- **Relevance:** Useful for studying shifts in media formats, visual culture, and institutional memory over time. Computational tools could analyze visual and textual patterns across decades[1][9].

### **4. Web Archives**
- **Content:** Archived MSU websites since 2000.
- **Relevance:** These archives allow for longitudinal studies of digital media evolution and institutional communication strategies. This aligns with your interest in using computational methods to study digital traces of the past[1][3].

### **5. Academic Programs, Course Descriptions, and Schedules**
- **Content:** Detailed records of academic offerings from 1970–2020.
- **Relevance:** These materials can help trace the development of curricula related to media studies or Global South studies at MSU. Computational analysis could reveal trends in academic priorities over time[1][3].

### **6. Civil War Collections**
- **Content:** Letters, diaries, and photographs from 1861–1866.
- **Relevance:** While earlier than your primary focus era, these materials could be used for comparative studies on how media technologies (print vs. digital) shape historical narratives[1][3].

### Recommendations for Digital Humanities Approaches:
- Employ **text mining** or **topic modeling** to analyze large textual datasets like oral histories or yearbooks.
- Use **network analysis** to map relationships between individuals or institutions in the Vietnam Group Archive.
- Apply **visual recognition algorithms** to study imagery trends in yearbooks or photographs.

These collections provide a robust foundation for exploring how information and media have been produced, preserved, and represented in different historical contexts.

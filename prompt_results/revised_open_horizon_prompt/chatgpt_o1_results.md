## Model Response

Below are several Michigan State University Libraries Digital Collections (and affiliated projects) that may speak directly to your interests in post-1945 histories of information and media—especially in the Global South—and that lend themselves well to digital-humanities approaches. I’ve highlighted specific strengths, date ranges, and types of primary materials so you can see how each might fit into a research agenda on media and information flows.

1. African Activist Archive
What It Is: A digital repository of more than 10,000 items documenting U.S. activist support for African struggles for independence and democracy, roughly from the 1950s to the 1990s. Although hosted in collaboration with the African Studies Center at MSU, the materials often reference African political movements, media coverage of those movements, and the transnational circulation of political information.
Types of Sources: Newsletters, leaflets, pamphlets, buttons, photographs, audio recordings, and video footage from grassroots and national organizations.
Why It’s Relevant:
Offers rich insight into how information about Africa was disseminated globally, including the role of newsletters, small-press publications, and activist networks.
Demonstrates how U.S. activists shaped the global media environment by repackaging and circulating information about African political struggles.
Its digital holdings are often well-suited for text analysis (e.g., exploring recurring themes in newsletters over time).
Where to Start: African Activist Archive Project

2. African e-Journals Project
What It Is: A collaborative digitization project providing full-text access to selected academic and scholarly journals published in Africa. While many issues span the 1960s through the 2000s, coverage varies by title.
Types of Sources: Peer-reviewed journals, research bulletins, occasional papers in fields such as history, political science, communications, sociology, and literature—many of them difficult to find elsewhere.
Why It’s Relevant:
Excellent window into how knowledge and research circulated within Africa from the early postcolonial period onward.
Journals sometimes contain book reviews, commentary on media and information policies, and debates on communication infrastructures in newly independent states.
Ideal for large-scale text mining to study discourse trends (e.g., how “information policy” or “mass media” is discussed over time).
Where to Start: African e-Journals Project

3. G. Robert Vincent Voice Library
What It Is: One of the largest academic voice libraries in the United States, containing over 100,000 hours of spoken word recordings, including speeches, interviews, and broadcasts from the early 20th century to the present.
Types of Sources: Digitized recordings of political figures, activists, intellectuals, and news broadcasts. Coverage includes global leaders and key voices from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East—spanning the post-1945 period.
Why It’s Relevant:
Potential for acoustic and rhetorical analysis of how leaders in the Global South framed information and media issues during the Cold War and afterward.
Can be combined with text-based corpora to compare rhetorical strategies in print vs. broadcast media.
Many recordings can be requested in digital form, suitable for computational approaches such as speech-to-text analysis.
Where to Start: Vincent Voice Library at MSU

4. American Radicalism Collection
What It Is: While its primary focus is on radical movements in the United States, the collection (covering approximately the 20th century, with a particular strength in the post-WWII era) includes materials on anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, and solidarity groups that frequently engaged with issues in the Global South.
Types of Sources: Pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, and ephemeral documents from civil rights organizations, anti-war groups, socialist/communist parties, feminist collectives, and more.
Why It’s Relevant:
Many of these U.S.-based groups produced or circulated information about international struggles, including Latin American and African independence movements.
Offers insight into how “third world” liberation was interpreted, adapted, and publicized in U.S. radical and underground media.
The ephemeral nature (leaflets, short-run newspapers) makes it a compelling resource for computational text analysis of how certain key terms, slogans, or frames emerged around global issues.
Where to Start: American Radicalism Collection description (Digitized portions can often be found via the MSU Library’s Digital and Multimedia Center.)

5. MSU Vietnam Advisory Group Records (University Archives & Historical Collections)
What It Is: From 1955 to 1962, MSU ran a technical assistance project in South Vietnam known as the “Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group (MSUG).” The University Archives holds a significant body of documentation—some digitized—related to this advisory mission.
Types of Sources: Project reports, correspondence, policy documents, photographs, and occasional audio/visual media. While not all are digitized, there are select digitized records available for research.
Why It’s Relevant:
The MSUG project is a prime example of how American universities served as conduits of “development” knowledge and expertise in the postcolonial world.
Reveals communication strategies, propaganda, and training methods used to disseminate information and shape media in South Vietnam.
Potential for digital-humanities work comparing official documents to contemporary press coverage or to personal narratives from Vietnamese perspectives.
Where to Start: MSU Archives & Historical Collections (Search for “Vietnam Advisory” or inquire directly about digital content.)

6. Africana Special Collections (Pamphlet & Ephemera Series)
What It Is: Within MSU’s renowned Africana Library are multiple sets of pamphlets, brochures, political tracts, and ephemeral materials from various African countries—often from the 1950s onward (spanning independence movements to more contemporary developments).
Types of Sources: Pamphlets produced by political parties, NGOs, government information offices, trade unions, student groups, and more. Some have been digitized or cataloged with scanned excerpts.
Why It’s Relevant:
Pamphlets are an invaluable resource for studying “informal” or “parallel” media ecosystems, especially in places with limited mass media infrastructure.
They capture the immediacy of political messaging, propaganda techniques, and localized public information campaigns.
Working with these digitized pamphlets could involve entity recognition (e.g., mapping references to political figures or events), topic modeling, or sentiment analysis.
Where to Start:

Visit the Africana Library page and look for references to “Pamphlet and Ephemera Series” or consult the librarians about which materials are digitized and accessible online.
7. Comics & Graphic Materials in the Global South (Special Collections)
What It Is: MSU is home to one of the world’s largest public collections of comic books. Within that expansive holding, there are smaller sets of comics and graphic materials from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Some have been partially digitized, especially titles that relate to political or educational messaging (e.g., health campaigns, literacy campaigns).
Types of Sources: Political cartoons, government-sponsored educational comics, independent comic book series, and propaganda materials.
Why It’s Relevant:
Comics can reveal state and non-state uses of visual narrative for ideological or public health campaigns in post-independence contexts.
These materials often circulated alongside more traditional print media and can highlight alternative channels of information dissemination.
Digital comics collections allow for image analysis or computer vision techniques if you want to explore visual tropes or textual content within speech bubbles.
Where to Start: MSU Comics Collection — check for “International Comics” or inquire about digitized subsets focusing on the Global South.

Tips for a Digital Humanities Approach
Text Mining & Analysis: Many of the pamphlets, journals, and ephemeral publications come with OCR text or can be OCR-processed. You could apply topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or named-entity recognition to track how ideas about “information policy,” “media freedoms,” or “development communication” evolved across regions.

Geospatial Mapping: If your work touches on circulation networks or the spread of printed materials, you can extract place names (from, e.g., shipping routes noted in pamphlets or addresses on ephemeral newsletters) and map transnational distribution.

Network Analysis: Materials like the African Activist Archive or the American Radicalism Collection often contain lists of affiliated groups, correspondents, or endorsements. These data can be modeled as networks showing how information and activism connected Global South movements with international supporters.

Image/Visual Analysis: For political posters, brochures, or comics, consider leveraging computer vision to identify recurring iconography (e.g., certain flags, slogans, or imagery). The ephemeral nature of these materials can reveal short-lived trends in visual communication.

Getting Started
Search the Digital Collections Portal: MSU Libraries’ Digital & Multimedia Center is the main gateway. Refine searches by date (post-1945), region (Africa, Asia, Latin America), or format (pamphlet, recording, poster, etc.).
Consult Subject Librarians: Particularly the librarians for African Studies, Asian Studies, and Latin American Studies. They can help you uncover newly digitized or lesser-known collections.
Check Rights & Usage: If you plan computational analyses, verify that the materials are in the public domain or that they permit text/data mining.
With these collections, you should have a robust starting point for investigating how information and media circuits developed in the post-1945 Global South—and for applying digital-humanities methodologies to reveal patterns in those circuits. Good luck with your research!

I need to be transparent that while I aim to be helpful, I cannot directly access or search through Michigan State University's Libraries Digital Collections in real-time. However, I can engage with you about your research interests and suggest some potential areas to explore based on what I know about MSU's collections.

MSU Libraries has notable digital collections that would align with your research focus, particularly:

1. The G. Robert Vincent Voice Library - This contains recordings from the mid-20th century onward, including speeches and interviews with political figures, activists, and intellectuals from various parts of the Global South.

2. The African Media Program collections - MSU has historically been a major center for African Studies, and their digital collections include materials related to media and information flows in post-colonial Africa.

Given your interest in post-1945 information and media history in the Global South, you might want to specifically investigate:

- The United States Information Agency (USIA) materials in their collections, which document American information and propaganda activities in developing nations during the Cold War
- Their Vietnam War-era collections, which include materials about media coverage and information dissemination
- The African activist and independence movement materials, which often touch on questions of information control and media development

As a digital humanist, you might be particularly interested in their collections that have already been digitized and OCR'd, making them amenable to computational analysis.

Would you like to tell me more about the specific aspects of information and media history you're most interested in? That would help me suggest more targeted materials within these collections. Also, are you planning to do any particular types of computational analysis that might influence which materials would be most suitable? |

Michigan State University's Libraries Digital Collections offer a wealth of materials that could be highly relevant to your research interests. Here are some specific collections and resources you might find useful:
1. **African e-Journals Project**: This collection includes digitized journals published in Africa, covering a wide range of topics including media, communication, and information studies. It could provide valuable insights into post-1945 media landscapes in the Global South[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
2. **East African Newspapers**: This collection features newspapers from Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, dating from the 1940s to the 1970s. These primary sources can offer a rich perspective on the dissemination of information and media practices in the region during the post-1945 era[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
3. **African Activist Archive**: This archive documents the history of activism in Africa, including materials related to media and information dissemination. It includes posters, pamphlets, and other media that can shed light on the role of information in social movements[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
4. **Latino and Latin American Collections**: These collections include a variety of materials such as newspapers, magazines, and other media from Latin America. They can provide insights into the media history and information practices in the Global South, particularly in the post-1945 period[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
5. **South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA)**: While focused on the South Asian diaspora in the United States, this collection includes materials that reflect the media and information practices of South Asian communities, which could be relevant to your study of the Global South[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
6. **Digital Repository**: The MSU Libraries Digital Repository offers a wide range of digitized materials, including documents, newspapers, journals, images, and data. You can search for specific topics related to your research interests and find relevant materials[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
These collections should provide a solid foundation for your project. If you need more specific guidance or assistance, the MSU Libraries' Digital Repository Team can help you navigate the collections and find the materials most relevant to your research[[1]](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul).
Good luck with your project! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.**References**[1] [MSU Libraries Digital Collections - Michigan State University](https://d.lib.msu.edu/msul)

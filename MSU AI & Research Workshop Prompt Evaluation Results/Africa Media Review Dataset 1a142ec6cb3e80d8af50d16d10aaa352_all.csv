https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/81,A critical appraisal of the communication gap in the liberation struggle,"This paper calls for a critical appraisal of the use of the politically loaded words which are normally associated with liberation struggles. It suggests that these terms are often vaguely defined and mean different things to different publics. Their constant use, therefore, tends to obscure the message and to create a communication gap. The writer subscribes to the view that, contrary to the intention of the message senders, many of the descriptors used present a denigrating image of the groups they set out to help and that both these descriptors as well as the criteria for classifying the groups should be reconsidered. This she thinks, is one of the important assignments which development communicators should undertake.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/81/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1987,"Sybil, L.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/39,A return to basics : media rights as fundamental human rights,"This paper presents a challenging and radical contribution to the debate about media laws and politics in Kenya. The internationalist universalist dimension is critical and eye-opening. It is a lampoonery of the dichotomised 'them' against 'us' axis upon which the discourse on media legislation reforms revolves. Instead, the author recommends that the debaters should embrace an important trilogy: the state, the media and the citizen. This, the author argues, will help in removing the debate away from the infrastructure of a free media as the only bone of contention, to include the 'spirit"" of the media laws. The interest of the argument, therefore is to create a people-centered and responsive media. The people are integral stakeholders in the media industry, and as is, it is argued, must be as protected by the constitution as the media rights. The foregoing premise logically lends itself to the conclusion that media rights are human rights. If so then the author insist that the debate about media reforms is ill-informed if it doesn't include constitutional reform. But he goes past this to embrace a universalistic approach to the review of media laws. This is consistent with the paradigm shift in the development and application of the modern human rights laws and international politics, which started with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the Genocide Convention (1948), the Geneva Convention of 1949, the Convention of Refugees (1951), the International Government on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966). Within these internationally binding legal instruments, the author says, the media can find supportive articles for their demand for the inclusion of media rights as human rights. In this new internationalist thinking, the nationalistic or territorial approach to human rights issues have been found to be wanting as concerned governments have repeatedly violated national laws with impunity. There is no guarantee that national media laws will not be derogated by the despotic regimes again. Having traced the origins of the universalisation of human rights to the wartime atrocities of Nazi regime, the paper contends that the media today is an important international diplomatic player in conflict prevention, management and resolution to be left at the mercy of the draconian whims of an authoritarian government. The author declares that freedom of expression is the first freedom. Therefore it ought not to be negotiable. The paper laments mistreatment of the Kenyan journalists and their institutions by the powers that be.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/39/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Mwagiru, Makũmi (/search?fq=name_author:Mwagiru%2C%5C%20Mak%C5%A9mi)","Mass media--Law and legislation

A systemic approach to information management at the grassroots must address not only rural areas but also urban peripheries.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/251,A systems model for political communication : a case study in academic mythmaking,"This article critiques a specific systems theorist in terms of academic mythmaking. Barthes (1972) argues that myths contain a kernel of truth for ""the form does not suppress meaning, it only impoverishes it. But the kernel is hardly the whole corn, and if it is substituted for the whole, it will mislead any attempt to understand that whole. In this paper, I will show how this self-deception affects the systems theorist's analysis, and his practical efforts to transform social processes outside the confines of academia. The ""kernel of truth"" is taken as the whole truth, and hence distorts, misleads and mythologises concepts and processes upon which the analysis is based. Three articles are critically examined in view of the potential of self-deception and show that the systems analysis discussed cannot provide new insights into the ""complex process of political communication"" beyond entrenching the prevailing order.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/251/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Heydenrych, Kevin (/search?fq=name_author:Heydenrych%2C%5C%20Kevin)","Myth

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/28,"Action media : consultation, collaboration and empowerment in health promotion","Communication for health promotion is a complex process that is further problematised by limitations within communication theory. Linear models of communication give primacy to the communicator and see communication as a largely objective process. These models, which are often referred to as ""communicator-message-receiver"" (CMR) models, incorporate the communicator as a primary agent in determining the nature of information and the mechanisms for information flow. Action media is presented as a methodology for the development of media products that integrate the interests of both the communicator and representatives of target audiences within a health promotion context. The methodology has its roots in participatory action research (PAR) approaches and incorporates qualitative contextual research with a media development process. It is not intended that the methodology be perceived as an exclusive and absolute means for the development of health promotion materials. Rather, it adds to the range of methodologies health promoters can apply in media development, whilst also providing important insights into context-based activities that are consultative, collaborative and empowering. Action Media as it pertains to health promotion, has the following elements: Identification of significant health challenges; identification of sufficiently homogenous groups within defined geographic areas and collaboration with individuals within each context to co-facilitate workshops. The media products that emerge typically reveal deep insights into perspectives of the target group, are immediately relevant to the participant' s peer communities, and may be relevant nationally as health promotion products.The methodology differs considerably from producer centric approaches in that it sees contexts of media utility as dynamic, and furthermore, sets out to generate media products that are supportive of action, rather than simply as vehicles for information. Within the complex contexts of media development, the Action Media methodology provides insight into the potential for integration and empowerment of individuals and groups within target communities. It demonstrates a replicable process that provides for the development of deeply contextualised media products on the one hand, and qualitative understandings of community contexts on the other.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/28/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Parker, Warren (/search?fq=name_author:Parker%2C%5C%20Warren)","Drama in health education

It moves to underscore pluralism that exists as a result of advanced information technology. This rush towards information technology, is largely interlinked to economic factors. The paper advocates for research in indigenous communication to augment modern communication. It argues that Africa's potential in indigenous knowledge and practices remains largely untapped, adding that information and knowledge can be effectively transmitted using indigenous forms of communication, which are characterised by simplicity of technology and directness of interaction.

The National Concord was followed by the New Nigerian newspaper which in 78 issues had 49 errors of the misapplication of the English elliptical rule. The paper with the lowest incidence of the misuse of THE1 was the Daily Star. It was virtually free of the error in question (only 2 errors in 78 issues). The position of occurrence of the linguistic error discussed and their distribution, have a number of implications for the training of the African journalist and for his mastery of the intricate art of writing for effective newspaper communication.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/106/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1988,"Ayodele, Olumuyiwa (/search?fq=name_author:Ayodele%2C%5C%20Olumuyiwa)","Nigerian newspapers

It profiles the Nigerian non-literate farmer, critically re-examines the concept of literacy and considers the factor of the orally literate in agricultural communication. Of the various factors responsible for poor agricultural production, the article concentrates on the need for effective dissemination of scientific agricultural information. It works at the communication needs of the non-literate farmer and appraises communication and information flow within this environment. It then identifies the various channels by which the rural farmer can be reached and influenced. It submits on a final note that illiteracy in the Western sense does not preclude access to scientifically based agricultural information and adoption of improved agricultural practices.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/105/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1988,"Soola, E.

Agricultural programmes were limited in focus, perspective and range of issues treated. The programmes were mainly concerned with the transfer of technology and ideas to the neglect of other crucial socio-structural issues. Because it has been difficult to get sponsors for agricultural programmes, unlike entertainment programmes which dominate the prime viewing hours, the policy of commercialisation is responsible for the lack of agricultural programmes on Nigerian television.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/227/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1993,"Oso, Lai (/search?fq=name_author:Oso%2C%5C%20Lai)","Television programs

He reviews the major American mass communication theories, and demonstrates that each of them is based on some American philosophy or world view. He then argues that any appropriate philosophy of mass communication in Africa must originate from African philosophy, defined in a fairly broad manner.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/62/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1987,"Okigbo, Charles (/search?fq=name_author:Okigbo%2C%5C%20Charles)","Communication--Research

The study was aimed at finding out if there is a general agreement between American journalists and their readers on the kind of African news that is important and interesting to American readers. The research method used was sample survey. An initial sample of 200 readers and 40 journalists were randomly selected for the study. Only 72 readers and 16 journalists completed and returned the questionnaire sent to them by mail. Four newspapers were included in the study. The study found, among other things, that most of the readers studied read foreign news, almost all the respondents read at least one of the articles about Africa in the newspapers included in the study. It also found that more than half of the journalists and readers agree that there is more news about disaster and politics than about other types of news.

The aims of the study were five-fold: To provide emphirical evidence on the orientations, objectives and scope of the existing curricula in journalism and communication training in East Africa; to suggest variousways of re-modelling the curricula; to access the quality of training offered to journalists so as to find out if they are being adequately funded and teachers well remunerated and; to generate fresh data on journalism and communication training in the region which can be used by policy makers and implementors in shaping future training needs. Field survey research design was used to collect data from stations, newspapers, training institutions and governmental departments. A total of 19, 21 and 22 respondents from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya respectively were interviewed. The study raises concern over two pertinent issues: the fact that the training institutions have less teaching staff and that the curricula used are relatively old with the newest having been drawn in 1994. The author suggests that there ought to be regular review of the curricula to make them responsive to the ever-changing media demands.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/36,Communication policies in civilian and military regimes : the case of Ghana,"This is a critical evaluation of the media legislation in Ghana since independence. It reveals the chequered government-press relationship that perpetuated a timid press in Ghana, but which is tending to thaw under the weight the new media legislations promulgated by the reformed President Jerry Rawlings' government. The article gives an instructive glimpse into the press. It argues that the former president sought to use the media as a tool for propaganda and ideological indoctrination, which he wrongly believed was necessary not only for national and continental unity but also for Ghana's economic and political maturity. The author argues that the Pan-Africanist president engineered the enactment of media laws that were aimed at entrenching his monopolist economic policies as well as his endeavour to establish political monotheism and strong anti-imperialist stand in Ghana. The inevitable result was a complete strangulation of the press, culminating in the state emerging as the sole player in the industry. Freedom of expression became inconsistent with his ""consciencism"", therefore, was utterly denied. Human rights was indeed treated with contempt by the CPP government, if the harsh legislations are to go by. Surprisingly, the media in Ghana got their first states of pseudo-freedom under a military junta, led by military strongman, Busia. This weak tolerance of press freedom and, by extension, civil liberties, was continued by Dr. HuUa Limann's government. The use of satellite dishes were allowed under this Third Reich for the time in Ghana. That notwithstanding, both the regimes failed to decriminalize libel and repeal draconian sedition laws, that negatively impacted on media operations. The paper also points out that the state monopoly of the airwaves remained intact. Likewise, the paper argues, any perceived press liberties in Ghana were impaired and contradicted by legal decrees like the Provision of Rumours Decree, which criminalized broadcasting or printing of anything seen to be against the National Liberation Council, the Police or the Armed Forces. This, the author says, created a widespread 'culture of silence' among media practitioners. The author recognizes the positive developments in the media industry by way of relatively friendly media bills, but, at the same time, regrets the lack of a clear policy to deal with the New Information World Order. He picks issues with the domination of the Ghanaian broadcast media by cheap, culturally imperialistic, alien programmes. The lackadaisical development of the rural press is lambasted while calling on the government to protect the poor's right to relevant information and their sources. The paper concludes by calling for the creation of a truly democratized legal infrastructure for the media to enable them to participate actively and fully in national development.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/36/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Gadzekpo, Audrey (/search?fq=name_author:Gadzekpo%2C%5C%20Audrey)","Mass media policy

The complexities of such conflicts vary from one country to another making it impossible for the organizations concerned to find one single mechanism for conflict resolution. A lot more is to be done by the churches and the world bodies to explore common factors in social conflicts; to sensitize the participants in matters of religious tolerance, justice and peace; to highlight support and encourage the role of churches and other groups in promoting dialogue among the warring protagonists. This article portrays the situation in the Sudan and provides indications as to how the problems should be addressed in an enlightened manner.

It argues that antagonisms between politicians and journalists have led to government nationalization and control of the mass media thus marginalizing the role of journalists as watchdogs on government conduct of public affairs. It calls for a redefinition of the role of the media in Nigeria more in accord with its history, culture and aspirations and away from the present western mode which only fans conflicts between the government and the mass media.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/255,Coverage of Africa by the African-American press : perceptions of African-American newspaper editors,"The news selection process of African-American newspaper editors in terms of news about Africa, was evaluated by addressing two research questions: (i) How do African-American newspaper editors decide which African news to publish? (ii) What influences their decision about the quantity and quality of coverage? A two-page questionnaire was mailed to African-American newspaper editors in 1991 and 1992. The study hypothesized that editors' perceptions of a foreign news event had a direct and significant impact on the way they process the news stories they receive daily. The study reveals that gatekeeping practices of African-American newspaper editors were basically similar to those of other western editors. This was not surprising given the similarity in their education, environment and newsroom socialization. The African-American newspaper editors are distinct, however, in subject matter of reporting. African-American newspaper editors think though, that positive involvement of the United States in the affairs of African countries would positively influence the education of the American public about the heritage of African-Americans. The reporting and issues in African-American newspapers were also investigated.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/255/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Onyedike, Emmanuel U.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/244,Covering the environment in the Ghanaian media,"This paper examines the coverage of environmental issues in the Ghanaian media, specifically in the two widely-circulated national newspapers, People's Daily Graphic and Ghanaian Times. The Graphic now circulates on the average 100,000 copies a day while the Times prints and distributes about 60,000. Coverage of environmental news for the month of June 1990 was examined in detail. June was selected because it is an active month for Environmental activities. The writer also studied the two newspapers in September 1990 for comparative studies. The study revealed that there seems to be a general concern with environmental hazards, but their importance relative to other issues is yet to be grasped. There is not much publicity given to the impact of population growth and soil erosion on the environment. Reporters have neither special interest nor special skill in reporting on the environment. Most of the features are contributed by UN agencies or foreign news agencies.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/244/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Yankah, Kojo (/search?fq=name_author:Yankah%2C%5C%20Kojo)","Pollution

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/29,Cultural engineering and development,"Development institutions have in recent years realised the importance of indigenous culture as an important vehicle for communication. This has led to the creation of programmes in which local cultural forms have been ""recruited"" as the communication process for ""selling"" development strategies. The paper draws upon the author's experiences of theatre for primary health mobilisation and awareness in rural Malawi. The advantage of performing arts as a medium for development communication are that: 1) they provide a more entertaining form than monologous media, 2) they can easily use local languages and cultural forms such as songs and dances, 3) they encourage participation and debate in the audiences. The main disadvantage is that such intrumental use of the performing arts can lead to a cornmodification of culture which is manifested in: 1) the professionalisation of cultural workers in a context which is not normally commercial, 2) the reification and triviliation of community culture through the use of traditional external forms to convey messages totally at variance with their original context. Such cultural engineering, at its most insensitive can constitute a form of developmental imperialism which erodes rather than supports the cultural cement binding local communities. Suggested solutions demand agents' wide-ranging consultations, not only with development minded stake-holders, but also with those who possess cultural skills and interests.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/29/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Kerr, David, 1942- (/search?fq=name_author:Kerr%2C%5C%20David%2C%5C%201942%5C-)","Drama in health education

The second part identifies and critically discusses crucial issues, viz. the national interest, the need for quality programming, diversity in ownership and the preservation and promotion of our diverse cultures which, we argue strongly, must be acknowledged and resolved in as much as any meaningful effort to privatise the broadcast media in the country is concerned. In the third part, the paper considers as a challenge the necessity to resolve those issues aforementioned and concludes by recommending a policy option to guide the work of the newly formed National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in resolving these knotty issues.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/27,Developing cultural development policy research programmes : a focus on the material communities of cultural practice,"This article condenses the theoretical discussion carried out by the authors for a framing paper on cultural policy. In it, they begin from the position that most discourse about the term 'culture' makes it difficult to define an exact constituency which, for policy purposes, can propose and benefit from implementation. In the South African context within which they work, they point out that taking into account the dynamics and special needs of transition from apartheid to democracy makes this a doubly taxing problem. The authors accept that the present circumstances favour a more radical appreciation of the concept of culture and need than enshrined in existing cultural policy, for example, in Australia. Therefore, they draw on the radical post-marxist approach of philosopher Agnes Heller to relocate cultural discourse within the pragmatic category of ""raising endowments into talents"". On this basis, they proceed to identify, in terms of a politics of equitable transformation, the constituency most deprived in terms of raising endowments into talents under apartheid. These, the authors argue, are the women in single-parent or all-female households who have accomplished the business of seeing their children into higher education. As principal actors in the ongoing business of raising endowments into talents, the authors argue, such women constitute the basic constituency in contemporary South Africa towards whom cultural policy research should initially be directed. As cultural actors, they do not as such exist in a vacuum, however. Thus the actual pragmatic relations between this constituency and others involved in cultural practice are what policy implementation should strive to strengthen, empower and protect until generations with other, more elaborated, needs mature.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/27/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Guambe, Donald

They include local participation, integrated development, basic needs, women in development, and appropriate technology. These guidelines, carefully followed, have the potential to lead to project success. The problem is that it is the rare project wherein these guidelines have been observed.

In a bid to illustrate how this can happen, the paper outlines some approaches that can be adopted and how best to manage these strategies. Paramount in the process is the need to synchronise the issue to be dealt with, the audience for whom the communication message is intended, the nature of the media to be used, and the socio-political and economic context within which the media campaign is to be effected.

It reviews the liberal social theories upon which Third World studies have been anchored and rejects them for having led to the current crisis of theory in communication training. Opting for a Marxian political economy approach, it suggests, inter alia, the study of imperialism in all its manifestations as a way of understanding the current reality in Africa; the need to relate theory and practice (through field work) in communication training; and the incorporation of sufficient social science theories and applications thereof into communication syllabi of African training institutions.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/146/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1990,"Mohammed, Jubril Bala, -2001 (/search?fq=name_author:Mohammed%2C%5C%20Jubril%5C%20Bala%2C%5C%20%5C-2001)","Communication--Study and teaching

So is the status of development communication as a theoretical construct, as the multiplicity of its definitions suggests. These issues have become more critical in the light of recent world-wide political changes and of the many instances of debilitating ethnic conflicts. It is in this context that this paper investigated the incidence of development-oriented content in two Nigerian dailies, hypothesizing that, despite the claims that Nigerian newspapers have been excessively political, their contents are significantly more development-oriented than not and that this orientation is topically diversified and consistent over time. The results of the content-analysis study showed that the papers were more nondevelopmental in their orientation than developmental. Other aspects of the findings suggest, however, that sustained development requires a communication and governance system that accounts for both human rights and human needs.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/237/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1993,"Nwokeafor, Cosmas U.

The study finds evidence from a survey of 136 practising Tanzanian journalists to support the hypothesis that Tanzanian journalists are ill-prepared to meet the challenge of development journalism.

This is because 'development' no longer evokes patriotism in the present socio-political environment of the region. The paper also postulates that historical factors, political and economic mismanagement, and international economic and ideological interests have played major roles in stultifying sub-Saharan Africa's development thereby (a) limiting the capacity of its journalists to play meaningful roles in society, and (b) hampering the development of mass media in the region.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/178/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1991,"Odhiambo, Lewis O.

However, most of the technical means require developing nations to have their own DBS, either individually or on regional basis. And they might prove too costly for developing countries to use them. International law would help minimize international propaganda and even spillover. However, developing countries need to rally enough support to pass clearly-defined conventions regulating DBS and a powerful agency to enforce them.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/108,Domestic financing of communication in developing countries : a preliminary investigation of the Nigerian case,"This a case study of the Nigerian communication situation which examined the efforts by this developing country towards the mobilisation of domestic resources to finance communication industry. The study revealed that except, during the period 1981-1985, planned public investment in the communication sector has been moderately high at a level of 6.1% of aggregate ex ante expenditure. For the period 1960-1980, actual communications expenditure as a ratio of actual total expenditure was lower at an average of 4.5%. Total sector performance measured by the degree of resistance to plan distortions was lower for the communication sector relative to aggregate performance throughout the twenty four year period beginning in 1962, except during the second development plan period between 1970-1974. The trend in domestic public financing appears to have been dictated by two factors, namely the philosophy of economic planning and the fluctuations in economic fortunes. The oil book of the mid 1970s prompted the largest planned allocation of 9% during the period 1975-1980, although realized expenditure ""fell slightly below to a level of 7.2%. The article observes that these observed trends show clearly that there does not seem to have been any strong commitment by the Nigerian government to communication services to meet the needs of a significant portion of the population, especially those in the rural areas, and notes that this situation is not likely to change soon due to that country's present poor economy and the overemphasis by the government on market forces.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/108/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1988,"Osakue, John (/search?fq=name_author:Osakue%2C%5C%20John)","Communication policy

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/31,Drama : an appropriate tool in development support communication,"Development has been synonymous with directed, purposeful progress equated with economic growth. As such, communication for development has been largely understood as persuading people to adopt cut and dried messages which direct progress, hence the concept of mass communication. Unfortunately, this gives communication an apparatus for manipulation and propaganda dissemination. The widespread failure of development projects may be attributed to this understanding and practice of communication in development as communication becomes a way of forcing receivers to adjust and adapt to ideologically mediated messages. This paper proposes drama as an efficacious tool for development support communication. Drama incorporates aspects of lived realities, supports progress in peoples' lives and effectively grips the audience's attention and commitment. Drama conscientises people on aspects of life such as environmental conservation, assists people in spreading and using technological advancement, assists in health, educational and other social efforts and programmes. In this way, drama provides a viable tool in development support communication and, as the paper shows, drama is natural communication which can ensure high impact yet low cost effects.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/31/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Moyo, Felix F.

The paper suggests that if more women became trainers of journalists they would influence their students in their perceptions of the role of women in society.

In particular, it analyses the coverage of that crisis by six papers, namely, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Christian Science Monitor of the United States and the London Times, the Guardian, and the Daily Express of Britain.

It also notes, however, that the manner in which freedom is interpreted differs considerably from one region to another. The difference it points out, often manifests itself in the debate of complete government control of the mass media versus an independent press. The paper argues that the USA, which has a relatively longer history of political democracy spells out press freedom explicitly in the constitution as against the case in developing countries where freedom of press is not explicitly guaranteed by the constitution. It further argues that a country which has had a longer and relatively more stable form of government has a better chance of clarifying exactly what freedom of expression entails, and that freedom of expression is a dynamic process.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/291/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1995,"Gathu, Faith W.

The four stations had the same central purpose: opposition to whiteminority regimes.

The paper explores the following areas of concern: uses of new technologies, legalistic interpretations of freedom of expression, gender and new communication technologies, the information superhighway and public expectations, among others.

This article has attempted to propose a 12-stage theoretical paradigm in the process of problem identification and solution in ideological evolution within the context of the African mass media systems. As models are indispensable tools in the execution of a system's functions within the purview of public policy, such as the mass media, the theoretical paradigm on ideological evolution is, therefore, designed to point out the complementarity of theory and practice in information packaging. This article presupposes that media policy parameters are not only determined within the ideological directives of their society, but are also dependent variables of the larger policies that emanate from the ideology of their society. It is within such a setting that the contents of the national communication systems in Africa should function as microcosms that reflect the thinking of the macrocosmic entity.

It assesses some of the factors which have affected the development of the profession in that country. It offers a brief history of journalism in Ghana and reports among other things that there are about 650 journalists in the country, 467 of whom are employed by state-owned media organisations like the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation and the Ghana News Agency, and by the New Times and the Graphic Corporation, Ghana's two major newspaper establishments. According to the article, the journalism profession in Ghana is a male-dominated profession; only 13.3% of the 467 journalists in Ghana are women. The article also reported that there are two journalism training Institutions In Ghana, and that the main policy objective of journalism training in Ghana is to produce professionally trained personnel to operate and manage the country's mass media. It concludes by noting that journalism education in Ghana does not appear to be based on any specially-recognised state policy or integrated national development planning.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/104/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1988,"Boafo, S.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/246,Journalist responses to ethnic tensions : a study of the press in Kenya,"This two-pronged study is composed of a content analysis of the Daily Nation and the Kenya Times as well as a survey of 21 journalists who work for those two newspapers. The content analysis was conducted for the November 1, 1992 to January 31, 1993 editions of both papers, excluding Sunday editions. The sampling period included the final two months of the 1992 Kenyan general elections campaign, and the month that followed it. National news, opinion, and letter pages of both papers were analyzed. The survey featured some open-ended questions and some statements to which the respondents were asked to respond on a five-point scale ranging from ""disagreeing strongly"" through ""neither agree nor disagree"" to ""agree strongly"". The content analysis of the papers suggests that journalists are willing to report ethnic conflicts, especially if they result in violence. They believe ethnic tensions are influential, dangerous, and often politically motivated. Neither Daily Nation nor the Kenya Times de-emphasizes articles or opinions referring to ethnicity to an extent that would suggest that ethnic concerns do not exist, or are unimportant in Kenya. Both dailies avoided treating ethnic phenomena with silence. The survey suggests that the issue of ethnicity is not ignored; however it is not treated by journalists as the essential key to understanding the country. Kenyan journalists appear to be optimistic about the resolution of ethnic conflicts, and their role in that resolution.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/246/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Zaring, David (/search?fq=name_author:Zaring%2C%5C%20David)","Ethnic conflict--Press coverage

It poses and attempts to answer the questions: (a) who should define the role of the press? (b) how much control may the state exercise over the press? and (c) what accepted methods and instruments of control should the state adopt? It argues that state interest in the control of the press has been achieved through (a) determining how the press is to perform its role, and (b) by becoming part of the press (through ownership) and participating in defining its role. In Kenya, several legal and administrative instruments exist for controlling the press, which are to be found in public, private, criminal, commercial, and administrative legal processes. This state of affairs has not always permitted of smooth government-press relations irrespective of the legitimacy and justifiability of state action against the media. It suggests the establishment of a representative institution for canvassing various interests bearing on the performance and conduct of the press, granting and guaranteeing the right to a hearing before a tribunal before any curbs on the press are imposed, and the right of the press to appeal in the event of state action against it.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/141/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1990,"Okoth-Owiro, Arthur (/search?fq=name_author:Okoth%5C-Owiro%2C%5C%20Arthur)","Mass media--Law and legislation

It also draws attention to the time-honoured view of many communication scholars that analysis of the power of the mass media should not be predicated on the principle of ""all or nothing"", that the media are not all-dominating; neither are they all-liberating; that the media can be used for good or for evil, depending on the socio-political, economic and cultural environments in which they operate.

Proceeding from the premise that this relationship has been characterized by uneasiness and conflict, the paper seeks to identify the major causes of this conflict. It provides insights into why the conflictual relationship has not changed much since the advent of the democratization process. The paper also examines the strategies used by the state to deal with the mass media. The central argument here is that the relationship between the mass media and the state in Kenya is unlikely to improve unless two conditions are met. First, there must be commitment on the part of the state to democratic governance and a recognition of the legitimate role of the media in the promotion and protection of democracy. Secondly, there must be a vibrant civil society that is capable of obstructing attempts by the state to encroach on the rights and freedoms of the public, including the freedom of the press. The political orientation in state society relations in Kenya since independence has been characterized by a determination by the state to control society.

In Africa, the concept is a useful tool in explaining some of the development problems that have persisted through the years, especially in the areas of democracy and political communication.

In all these deliberations, the political, land and economic policies have taken precedence, while In the area of social reform, housing, education and welfare have featured prominently. Detailed attention to the media has been a later development. Even so, media remains something of a poor cousin relegated to a lower order of priority while other areas of concern are better articulated. On 23/24th November, 1991, the Department of Information and Publicity (DIP) of the ANC convened a meeting of approximately 300 delegates to discuss the drafting of a media policy. The outcome of this gathering was a document entitled, Resolutions adopted at the DIP National Seminar (ANC, 1991). The Resolutions were prefaced by a 'Draft Media Charter' which was also the result of the November deliberations. The Resolutions and the Charter were adopted by the ANC's National Executive Committee on 13th January, 1992, and remain the key expositions of ANC media policy.

Moreover, most of the female students surveyed consider journalism to be a profession as much suited for women as for men. However, it finds marital status to be an important factor in career choice; married students said they would quit work if it interfered with their family responsibilities.

Unfortunately for the South, and Africa in particular, the increased ease of global communication has not reduced the quantity and intensity of negative news about them. The paper cites instances where the Western media have capitalised on negative aspects of Africa. This state of affairs, has led to the fuelling of Afro-pessimism by non-Africans and Africans alike. Although the prospects for change exist, the absence of serious approaches by African states will reduce the pace of progress.

There were 11 articles from the New York Times and 12 from the Guardian. Each of the papers had a reporter assigned to cover the elections in Kenya. Qualitatively, the study tries to examine the connotation of the words and phrases within the particular context they are used so as to identify recurring themes that could correspond to each of the country's perceived self-interest. The analysis is divided into two phases - the period before the elections and the period after the elections. The first was examined under two sub-themes: election fairness and stability. The specific areas that the study analyzed were sources of information, threat to stability and headlines. Findings show that the mass media have become important and powerful instruments in today's process of foreign policy formulation especially in the US and Great Britain which are driven by national self interest.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/256/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Gikaru, Lawrence (/search?fq=name_author:Gikaru%2C%5C%20Lawrence)","Elections--Press coverage

He singles out the ""focus group' approach as being particularly suitable for data elicitation from Africans because it harmonizes well with their social-group orientation. This approach, he argues, has the merit of generating new hypotheses since it allows interviewees to respond or behave in unanticipated ways.

However, these standards did not apply to all the nations of the sub-region to the same degree, except for emphases and constructiveness.

It links the most salient images evoked by the mass media with the prevailing socioeconomic and political climates that have given impetus to current processes of ideological reproduction. Comparison of early reportage of Africa by European explorers and journalists (e.g. Stanley, Lugard) with contemporary media coverage of the continent reveals a persistent reference to Africans as barbaric, noble savages, communists and terrorists. Such references (images) have powerful ideological implications for the maintenance of the hegemony of a particular socioeconomic system over others.

Objectivity is the state or quality of not being influenced by personal bias, prejudice, feelings and opinions. Objective news-reporting Is that which is devoid of inferences. Judgement and slanting. Yet modern journalism is not altogether a professional practice in which the operators become, simply, automatons - unthinking, unfeeling and without emotion. Objectivity is thus a relative term - relative to the system that exists. The position adopted by this article is that objectivity in news presentation is not a myth, nor a mere philosophical abstraction, but an attainable media goal which the journalist must strive for, even in the face of opposing realities. Six factors which the journalist and the media must grapple with, if objectivity is to be meaningful and a worthwhile journalistic pursuit, are presented.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/117/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1988,"Ayodele, Olumuyiwa (/search?fq=name_author:Ayodele%2C%5C%20Olumuyiwa)","Journalism--Objectivity

This is due to the structure of mass media ownership and distribution which reflects pro-urban concentration and bias. This article argues that given this reality, one cannot legitimately and accurately talk of 'mass' communication in Nigeria since the media of mass communication is used mainly to talk to the masses rather than with the masses; neither are they used by the masses themselves to talk with each other. To this extent, therefore, there is a state of 'mass incommunication' in Nigeria, a state which calls for urgent change through democratization of the mass media.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/145/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1990,"Adesonaye, Festus (/search?fq=name_author:Adesonaye%2C%5C%20Festus)","Communication

The study finds similarities in the motivations behind the promulgation of Decree No. 4 and those behind the earlier libel and sedition laws, i.e. fear of those in authority of criticism. Although Nigerian courts were reluctant to uphold individuals' rights of free speech and opinion shortly after independence, the study finds that later court decisions have found sections of the criminal code and sedition laws which criminalize free speech to be anachronistic and unconstitutional.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/181/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1991,"Ogbondah, Chris W.

Thus, it discusses the extension and community development approach, the ideological and mass mobilization method, the centralized mass media method, the localized mass media method, and the integrated approach. It concludes that since development communication is not simply concerned with the mere provision of information on development activities, it should not stop with conventional mass media. Rather, it must involve strong components of social organization and interpersonal and traditional modes and media if it is to succeed. 'This title represents the present stage in the evolution of an appropriate name for 'those communication actions geared towards enlisting full human participation and understanding of development activities'. One of the earliest names was communication in support of development (IB11975). The IBI was followed by UNICEF in 1976 which called it 'project support communication'. The most popular name among social scientists and especially aid agencies has been 'development support communication'. But today, communication specialists working in the area of development, for obvious conceptual and operational reasons, prefer the name 'development communication'.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/131/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1989,"Moemeka, Andrew A.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/179,Political communications : press and politics in Nigeria's second republic,"This paper examines mass media bias in Nigerian political communications. It argues that ownership of the mass media in Nigeria tends to determine how they are used for political communications in the country. Other factors, such as ethnicity, religion, literacy, language of communication, legal limitations, political and socio-economic conditions, are also considered. The paper maintains, however, that the fact of ownership is not only the key which determines how the mass media are used for moulding the citizen's perception of political reality in the country, but that it is also a more precise means of understanding and investigating the role of the press in political stability or instability, national integration or disintegration. It concludes that as Nigeria approaches a third attempt at democratic rule in socio-economic conditions which are less propitious than in the past, there is a need for the Nigerian mass media to operate in a way which contributes to national integration.

Poverty, illiteracy, religion, cultural prejudices, male chauvinistic tendencies manifested in diverse patrilineal practices against women are some of the formidable forces that relegate women to the background. Portrayal of women in the media is examined through their portrayal in selected Igbo language films. The image of women in these films is found to be very bad and capable of negatively influencing the perception of women among the large audience of video films in Nigeria. The article shows that the technology of video has been effectively used for the empowerment of severely marginalised social groups like poor and illiterate women in some rural Third World countries. It is advocated that women actors should reject roles that relegate them to second fiddle.

The paper argues that a free press is vital in the development of the political economy of the sub-Saharan region. It attempts to demonstrate how a controlled press, such as the African press, is incapable of unearthing graft, fraud, theft, corruption, bribery, embezzlement, smuggling and export-import swindles inherent in the ruling bourgeois class. For, corruption and these other illicit economic ventures by the dominant African bourgeois class have been identified as part of the reasons for the failure of development projects in Africa.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/266/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Ogbondah, Chris W.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/289,Press freedom and the imperatives of democracy : towards sustainable development,"In this paper, the authors argue that press freedom is a key element of democracy. They, however, contend that for the press to serve its meaningful role towards a country's sustainable development, it must be transparent, accountable and responsible. The authors draw extensively from research findings in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, which to them are adequately representative of the entire Sub-Saharan Africa region. The paper discusses at length some factors which affect sustainable development, as well as the performance of the press in the two countries. The conclusions made are that the press systems in both Nigeria and Sierra Leone are neither democratic nor do they serve the cause of ensuring sustainable development. A major weakness, the authors maintain, is the fact that the press in the two countries pay more attention to the outside world than to issues affecting their predominantly illiterate population.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/289/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1995,"M'Bayo, Ritchard

It stresses the pertinent role of a democratized press in democratic political systems, and the role that the press can play within the democracies if they are conscious of the great responsibility that the current transition programmes of African nations places on them. In view of the rise of so many elites in Africa (those who almost always make headline news) and their great influence in mass media output as well as the economic considerations of many media organisations in news judgement, the paper reasserts the deep ethical and professional commitment of the mass media to protecting the underprivileged in society, interpreting their points of view and acting as the voice of the voiceless in society. The paper concludes that a holistic transition programme that recognises less government presence in mass media management and output is ideal for African nations.

The advantages of such an integrated strategy include a demonstrated effort by the development specialist to maximize the inputs of rural residents into development programmes early on, and a narrowing of the gaps among policy-makers, traditional/urban media institutions and the target groups. Such linkages also permit the identification of communication research priorities for a continuing programme of development, the coordination of such research among all three agendas, and the coordination of development efforts among change agencies.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/63/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1987,"Pratt, Cornelius B.

First, what is the dominant ethical philosophy of the Nigerian press as indicated in its editorials? Second, what is the ethical responsibility of the press as indicated in its editorials? It examines the 'role-responsibility' of the press within the context of three dominant ethical themes: deontological, situational, and utilitarian ethics. A qualitative thematic analysis of the editorials indicates that the Nigerian daily press has a preference for applying utilitarian ethics to national issues. Situational ethics has the least presence in the editorials. The analysis also indicates that the government-owned newspapers are more likely than the privately-owned newspapers to use a utilitarian ethical perspective in expressing their opinions on, and in criticizing, government actions. This analysis concludes that by beginning to understand the different manifestations of government-press relationships and of media role in contributing to the nation's 'common good,' journalists can better plan for the difficult process of more effectively involving the press in national development.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/94/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1988,"Pratt, Cornelius B.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/268,Sensitizing policy makers on population issues : the PIP experience in Ghana,"Ghana was the third country in sub-Saharan Africa, after Kenya and Mauritius, to adopt a formal and explicit Population Policy in 1969. But the consensus at a major conference held in 1989 to assess the policy after 20 years of its operation was that on balance it had failed to achieve its main objectives. This chapter examines the reasons why fertility remains almost at the same level as it was in 1969 with the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) only a little marginally lower at 6.4 in 1988 as compared with the previous 6.7 (G.D.H.S., 1988). The crude death rate had declined somewhat from the 20's to a level around 15 per 1000, but infant, child and maternal mortality remained at unacceptably high levels, and most importantly, the population growth rate which was projected to decline to 1.7 per cent by the end of the decade still remained at its high level of around 3.0 per cent. Modern contraceptive usage was disappointingly low at only 5 per cent (G.D.H.S., 1988).",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/268/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Aryee, Andrews Frederick (/search?fq=name_author:Aryee%2C%5C%20Andrews%5C%20Frederick)","Population Impact Project

However, the continuing search by Nigeria since independence for more dynamic, efficient and relevant strategies of achieving real development does imply frustration with past attempts as well as our inability to maximally and positively exploit these resources for the upliftment and well-being of the Nigerian people. This has resulted in the marginalisation of the vast majority of the people in the transformation process, particularly because of the low level of their education and, therefore, low consciousness which not only made them vulnerable to fraudulent manipulations by politicians, but has created among them a culture of helplessness, apathy and indifference about the happenings in the political and economic process.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/163/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1990,"Adamolekun, ʾWole (/search?fq=name_author:Adamolekun%2C%5C%20%CA%BEWole)","Communication in social action

It examines the concept and elements of social mobilisation and the extent to which social mobilisation has been applied to improve people's participation in the Botswana national literacy programme. The analysis of social mobilisation practice in Botswana has shown that when mobilised, people participate in large numbers in development programmes. For example, mobilisation activities which were mounted during a period of one year between when the programme started as an experiment and when it was officially launched as a national programme resulted in impressive participation statistics. Finally, the article suggests the application of both social mobilisation and a literacy approach that is amenable to social mobilisation, if Botswana is to eradicate or greatly reduce adult illiteracy by the year 2000.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/283/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1995,"Nyirenda, Juma E.

People considered celebrities often make huge sums of money from endorsing products or services. One area of interest in the employment of endorsers is their use in every day, cheap and widely available products. This study explored the consequences for credibility of the use of international, high-brow celebrities in endorsing these kinds of products. A sample of students of the Department of Mass Communication at the Anambra State University of Technology was used. Questionnaires measuring their attitudes towards the use of an international, sophisticated endorser on a currently running Lux commercial were administered. Results show that the use of such type of endorsement did not have any significant positive impact on perception and overall credibility of the endorsement.

While extolling the virtues of the new democratic culture in the country, the paper also underscores the centrality of the press, especially the media, in nurturing and safeguarding the new plural political system. The author argues strongly that the formation of a more media friendly communication policy, to create a final and rapid break with the divisive past, is imperative. The paper enjoins the new government of national unity to devise comprehensive communication policy and profound training packages for journalists to strengthen and professionalize the media industry, as an instrument of national development. It contends that democratic growth requires a free and authoritative press to provide a forum for national debate, where people can exchange critical and competitive views, to enable them to make rational or informed choices on various matters critical to national cohesion. This, the author says, is only possible if the new communication policy establishes efficient information feedback mechanisms.

Cultural studies seek emancipation; administrative research contributes to social control. The paper ends with a discussion of African cultural theorists and their application of Marxism in anti-colonial struggles on the continent. Some of the problems evident in such scholars and activists as Cabral, Fanon and Ngugi wa Thiong'o are examined.

Not only soldiers take to arms, but civilians too get swept along by events. Across the world the sad story is the same: faces marked by grief, pain and loss. At this point when needs are at their greatest, local health-care services are often in no state to respond. Hospitals may have been destroyed, staff are afraid to go to work, and medical supplies are extremely limited. When their lives are at stake, civilians have no choice but to abandon their homes and land and seek safety elsewhere. They must leave all their possessions behind, they are often separated from other members of their family and after facing the trauma of war, they must face an uncertain future. Crammed together in public buildings, huddled up in makeshift shelters in vast camps or by the roadside, they are utterly dependent on outside assistance.

The findings suggest that the contribution of the mass media to integrative tendency varies according to media type and dimension of integration.

The creation of new states was accompanied by the proliferation of television stations until the establishment of the Nigerian Television Authority (N.T.A.) checked this proliferation and wastage of resources.

A combination of two research methods was employed: a secondary analysis of a sample of 1,213 ""better educated"" adults in three urban areas of Nigeria in November, 1981 commissioned by the United States Information Agency (USIA), and a content analysis of the international edition of Newsweek for October and November, 1981, seven weeks before and during the survey. The investigation yielded inconclusive results in its comparison of the Newsweek agenda to the magnitude of the relationships between reading Newsweek and selecting each of the same problems as important. Specifically, when comparing the Newsweek's coverage of 12 international problems to Newsweek readers' agenda (as compared to non-readers, controlling for background factors), measured from the estimated effects of Newsweek readership and reliance on the selection of each of these problems, a modest positive but non significant rank-order correlation (r = 0.475) was found.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/254/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1994,"Tanjong, Enoh, 1955-

It proceeds to argue that the mass media portray women and issues affecting them in a manner that is predominately negative and 'special' as though women were not part of 'normal' society. This has constituted overt or covert mental oppression of women.

And the upsurge of electronic networking through computers which is generally called the information superhighway appears to be a development that can precisely address this need. However, as more and more environmental information on a global scale continues to be stored and controlled electronically, developing countries risk becoming more marginalized within the rapidly evolving world economy due to lack of computers and low levels of computer literacy among the majority of their population. The question is: what are the likely consequences of this situation bearing in mind the understanding that environmental degradation does not affect Africa only or but the whole globe?.

Both institutions need each other as they try to influence the direction, pattern and issues of democratic transition.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/34,The new press bills in Tanzania : implications for national communication policy and press freedom,"This is a modest critique of the oppressive media laws in Tanzania, arising from the country's still-born socialism, which was adopted at the Arusha Declaration of 1967. The emperor worship syndrome characteristic of the first and, to a large extent, second generation of the autocratic presidents of African states, led them to muzzle the press and trample on their subjects' fundamental human rights like freedoms of expression, association, conscience, assembly and much else, is presented as the historical origin of a feeble press in the continent, including Tanzania. Taking Tanzania as the unit of analysis, the article argues that such undemocratic tendencies have no place in the modern world. The Tanzanian government is, therefore, invited to review its communication policies to make them more responsive to media development. The starting point should be the repealing of the obsolete media laws, to enable the media to play their adversary roles to the government objectively, authoritatively and independently. The paper then explores the various media legislations and concludes that the country has a vague communication policy which needs to be changed. In summary, the author philosophises and sympathises with the hackneyed view that there is no absolute freedom, therefore, in a way understands the limitations put in the way of the Tanzanian media by the new press bills.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/34/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Shoo, Gideon (/search?fq=name_author:Shoo%2C%5C%20Gideon)","Press law

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/38,The new press bills in Uganda : implications for national communication policy and press freedom,"This paper presents the government of Uganda's perspective of professionalization of journalism and the liberalisation of the media in the country. It is apologetic to the restrictions on the freedom of the press in Africa, for some unspecified conditions peculiar to African States. Some encouraging developments within the media industry, especially the liberalisation of the airwaves and the introduction of a degree course in journalism at the Makerere University, are discussed. However, the author mildly criticizes the suspect Media and Broadcast Councils whose composition are dominated by people handpicked by the Minister for Communications. The Media Council is empowered to license and discipline journalists and the media institutions. The question raised by many is whether the Councils are not merely a cathartic strategy by the government calculated to pacify an aggressive media that had started challenging the government's continued stronghold on the industry despite its claim that it's democratic. Whatever the case, as a watchdog in a democracy, the media's independence is critical. This is why the author is calling for a more comprehensive communication policy in Uganda. The paper raises questions over the wisdom of subjecting the Councils to the mercy of a government grant and some obscure ""acceptable sources"" for their cash, arguing that this will in the long run thoroughly compromise the independence of the two bodies. The paper raises the freedom of information provision, albeit with a grain of salt. It points out, for example, that the provision is contradicted by the Official Secrets Act, which make it difficult for government sources to divulge information to journalists. In conclusion, it ask the government to address the issue of media ownership in Uganda, using relevant statutes, with a view to making them accessible to the poor. To argue this case, the writer adopts the theoretical framework of the dependency theorists, who invites developing (periphery) countries to dissociate themselves culturally and economically from the developed (core) countries as the only means of achieving their true independence.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/38/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Nassanga, Goretti Linda (/search?fq=name_author:Nassanga%2C%5C%20Goretti%5C%20Linda)","Press law

This article identifies and examines Freire's educational ideas which offer most important contribution to understanding educational practices and discusses their relevance to education and development in contemporary Africa in terms of the extent to which they are still of value. These ideas include Freire's theory of conscientization and dialogue, liberating education, a criticism of banking education, and a criticism of the concept of extension as cultural invasion. The examination of these ideas shows that, given the existing realities in African societies today, particularly in the rural areas, Freire's ideas now appear more relevant to education and development in Africa than ever before.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/2/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1996,"Nyirenda, Juma E.

Before this year, most communities in this continent ran their own affairs in relative independence, within a clearly understood ethnic region. The most significant characteristics of an ethnic community were it's language and culture. Although the new foreign masters did not always clearly perceive or appreciate these social elements, the diversity and the wealth of these entities was enormous in the African continent.

Accordingly, their relevance must be seen in relation to the extent to which they promote the developmental and democratic aspirations of the majority of the people. And, as such, training of African media practitioners must be predicated on the necessity to give them clear orientation for the achievement of these goals.

It argues that although there is a unanimous acknowledgement of mass media's role in the conduct of foreign affairs worldwide and even among Tanzania's leadership, a lingering suspicion of journalists persits among most government officials which makes them withhold vital information from the country's local mass media. It recommends, among other things, an open dialogue between the officials of the Foreign Ministry and the press in the effort to forge a working relationship that would facilitate wide debate in the conduct of foreign affairs and international issues as it is the case in a socialist democracy.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/132/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1989,"Kamuhanda, Sethi (/search?fq=name_author:Kamuhanda%2C%5C%20Sethi)","Mass media--Political aspects

However, a consideration of the actualization of this concept is indicative of the media's failing in playing these roles. Very often, the media marginalise and disempower the masses whose causes they ought to promote.

This paper examines the substence of health communication education, its role in disease prevention and control, as well as the appropriate methodologies to adopt for greater effectiveness. The ultimate goal of this paper is to stimulate health communication education practitioners into coming up with ideas on how communication can be made to play a more effective role in effecting behaviourial change, and thus an overall improvement of people's health. Impediments to achieving this goal as well as known approaches that have been implemented with success are highlighted. Furthermore, the paper argues a case for the need to adopt a two-way approach in communicating health messages unlike the traditional system where the source was considered more important than the destination. The individual's needs, preferences and environment, argues the paper, count in determining the extent of success in a given health communication education campaign.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/282/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1995,"Bagui, Gabriel J.

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/44,The use of traditional communications in conflict management : the case of Uganda,"Conflicts have always been part of human society and mechanisms to resolve them have often tended to reflect the level of political organisation in a particular society. The traditional African society is rife with varied approaches to conflict management. Uganda, for example, is a heterogeneous society which prior to colonial rule was organised around chiefdoms among some tribes and clan elders among others. In the Kingdom areas such as Buganda, Ankore, Bunyoro, Toro and to some extent in Busoga the king ruled through institutions such as the hierarchy of chiefs and laws. In segmentary societies such as Kigezi, Bugisu, Bamba, Bakonjo and the Iteso, the political and social organisation was clan based, regulated by customs and values. In pre-colonial Uganda each society had set conventions, customs and traditions which regulated social behaviour, harmony and stability. These unwritten laws provided a set of acceptable behaviour and controlled deviants in society. Despite the differences in political organisation, it is generally agreed that each of these societies had elaborate systems of governance, rule of law, justice and administrative organs. Each member of society was supposed to know his rights and sanctions were imposed on those individuals who did not comply with the norms. This article will address the issue of conflict, how it was dealt with in traditional African culture, the methods of communication both in traditional and modern Uganda and the question of rights and responsibilities in promoting cross-cultural amity.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/44/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Sewanyana, Livingstone (/search?fq=name_author:Sewanyana%2C%5C%20Livingstone)","Conflict management

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/30,The use of traditional forms in community education,"This paper challenges the entrenched Shannon and Weaver model of communication and suggests alternative approaches to community health education. An alternative, where the emphasis falls on the receiver or 'reader', is examined with special reference to DramAidE. DramAidE is a South African state funded HIV/AIDS education programme in which plays, workshops and community days become a process through which dialogue around health issues is established between health workers and a school community. The approach is to use local expressive forms (plays, songs, poems, dances and posters) as enabling resources or mechanisms of learning and of re-enacting and retelling the 'story' from shifting positions. The issues raised about the impact on the community of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are further explored in participatory workshops with the intention of changing attitudes and developing some skills. The work is based on the premise that good health is dependent on social, psychological, economic and environmental factors. Likewise, sicknesses are states which must be seen in a holistic sense. The understanding of the meaning of health in this approach is culture bound and it is important not to separate out the physiological from the cultural. A further contention is that health, as a constituent and dynamic component of subjectivity does not refer to a state so much as to a process. This means that health is about self-image, self-esteem and self-confidence. The drama based workshops offered in the progamme focus on building self-esteem and self-awareness as a first step in making choices about healthy behaviour. Therefore, health education should not be actively aimed at changing personal behaviour alone. Young people need to demonstrate skills in changing their social environment and to this end DramAidE is forming clubs in schools that will become self-sufficient and to encourage the school community to take pride in building a culture of learning and health promotion in the school. The long term aim of DramAidE is to develop a social movement around celebrating the joy of choosing to live a healthy life style. We are asking ourselves and young people to 'Act Alive'. One strategy for mobilising young people is build an awareness of the interaction between human rights and health and thus find a common theme that cuts across differences of heritage and culture",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/30/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1997,"Dalrymple, Lynn I.

This film culture's peculiar relationship to the stage makes the stage referrential in two crucial respects. The first of these is in using mise-en-cadre and montage/editing, two basic structural elements in the mosaic of filmic construction, in working out the possibilities and limitations of the film medium. As regards mise-en-cadre, three essential correlates are deleanated: the physical relationship between the camera and the actor; the issue of point of view; and the frame as a crucial factor in the composition of the visual imagery and in the interpretation of the role of the actor. The other significant area in which the stage becomes referrential is in isolating the basic requirements for effective film acting.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/164/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1990,"Ekwuazi, Hyginus (/search?fq=name_author:Ekwuazi%2C%5C%20Hyginus)","Motion picture acting

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/42,Women and children in conflict situations : the culture of rights as a missing link in Africa,"Conflict in all its forms is endemic all over the world. Violent conflict is prevalent in Africa. Violent conflict exists within a triangle of relationships. This involves the belligerents and the citizens of whatever location the conflict is taking place. In many analyses of conflicts however, the citizens part of this triangle is often ignored. In particular, even within the 'citizens' corner of the triangle, the most vulnerable groups are rarely considered. The most vulnerable groups within any conflict situations are women and children. In normal situations, children and women in society require special care and protection. If this is accepted to be true in situations outside conflict, it is even more so in conflict situations. This article explores the basis on which the situation of women and children in conflict situations should be analysed. It outlines the broad canvass within which conflicts affect women and children, and examines the rights platform on which the welfare of women and children in conflict situations is based. It outlines the legal basis for the protection of women and children, and outlines the law on women and children in conflict situations. The article offers an analysis of 'rights', especially as they are perceived in the African context.

The ideas expressed on the role of women which prevail in Senegalese society lead to the belief that the role of a journalist and the role of women are incompatible with one another. This article, based on research among women journalists in Senegal, describes how women journalists perceive themselves as women and how they fulfill both roles.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/207/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1992,"Wijngaard, Rian van den (/search?fq=name_author:Wijngaard%2C%5C%20Rian%5C%20van%5C%20den)","Women journalists

https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/135,Zambia Broadcasting Corporation news : a content analysis,"This study of the news content of the Zambia Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) proceeds from the assumption that 'a national broadcasting system reflects the milieu in which it operates, thus taking on the colour of the social, political, economic and cultural climate' of its locale. Thus, hypothesizing that in Zambia, the broadcasting system would fulfil the objectives set by the ruling party and the government, namely, building a humanist nation, liberation of Africa, promotion of world peace and justice, and adherence to the policy of non-alignment, the study confirms that, indeed, the ZBC fulfils these objectives in its world news coverage. However, it identifies such structural constraints as news sourcing, lack of funds and transport, and lack of professional skills among ZBC newsroom staff as the major factors inhibiting quality performance.",https://d.lib.msu.edu/jamr/135/FULL_TEXT/view,Africa Media Review (/jamr),In Copyright,1989,"Mwaffisi, M.
